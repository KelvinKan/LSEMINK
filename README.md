# Getting Started

See [minimalExample.m](minimalExample.m)

# Reproduce Results in the Paper

To run the experiments, we have five driver codes (four for multinomial logistic regression and one for geometric programming):

	1) Main_small_MNIST.m
	2) Main_small_CIFAR10.m
	3) Main_RFM_MNIST.m
	4) Main_AlexNet_CIFAR10.m
	5) Main_GeometricProgramming.m

You will also need to install Meganet and CVX.

# Dependencies

The LSEMINK method is developed with MATLAB R2022a and should run with newer versions as well. No MATLAB toolboxes are required.

The following packages are required to repeat the image classification experiments:
1) MATLABâ€™s deep neural network toolbox (this is for the transfer learning component in the CIFAR-10 experiments).
2) [Meganet](https://github.com/XtractOpen/Meganet.m)

To reproduce the geometric programming experiments, you will need [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/).
